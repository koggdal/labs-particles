# labs-particles

Repository for my labs experiment Particles. The demo is only made for fun and not to produce the best code or performance.

## Build

The project is using CommonJS modules and can be built with a CommonJS module compiler such as [QuickStart](http://spotify.github.io/quickstart/).

Install project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Install QuickStart globally to build easier:

```
npm install -g quickstart
```

Build a compiler for the browser:

```
quickstart --self > runner.js
```

Or build the whole project:

```
quickstart --compress > runner.js
```
